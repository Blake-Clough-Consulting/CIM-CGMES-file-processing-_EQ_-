# CIM-CGMES-file-processing-_EQ_-
This is a Python tool for automated parsing and processing of CIM CGMES EQ datasets. The tool extracts all CIM classes from an EQ XML file contained inside a ZIP archive, converts each class into a structured CSV, and automatically enriches each CSV by resolving all rdf:resource references directly from the XML data.
